FedDpa's average time taken by each global epoch: 0 min 3.93 sec.

==================== FedDpa Experiment Results: ====================            
Display format: (before local fine-tuning) -> (after local fine-tuning)         
 So if finetune_epoch = 0, x.xx% -> 0.00% is normal.                            
 Centralized testing ONLY happens after model aggregation, so the stats between 
'->' are the same.
