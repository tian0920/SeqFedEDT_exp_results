Local-only's total running time: 0 h 3 m 11 s.                                  
==================== Local-only Experiment Results: ====================        
Display format: (before local fine-tuning) -> (after local fine-tuning)         
 So if finetune_epoch = 0, x.xx% -> 0.00% is normal.                            
 Centralized testing ONLY happens after model aggregation, so the stats between
